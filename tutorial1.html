          <h1><u>External Stylesheets</u></h1>
<h3>This method is best used, When you need to apply a styles sheet to multiple pages, it is often recommended to 
create an external Stylesheet and link it to various web pages.
An external style sheet is a separate file linked to an HTML web page. It comes with a .css filename extension. 
All the styles that need to be used on a website can be declared in the external style sheet.
External style sheets are an important tool from the webmaster’s perspective.
By applying consistent formatting to website pages, external style sheets help in bringing a uniform, 
global look and feel to a website. The external style sheet can be linked from HTML pages. 
When using an external style sheet, styles need to be set up only once for each element. 
The external style sheet contains only CSS syntax and also carries a “text/CSS” MIME type. 
One of the unique features associated with external style sheets is that they can be created in any text editor, 
but need to be saved with a .css extension. The file should never have any elements of HTML.
There are two main techniques of calling an external style sheet into an HTML document. 
One method is by using the &ltlink&gt tag within the HTML document head. 
Another method is with the help of a combination of external CSS functions along with embedded CSS.

There are benefits associated with external style sheets. The external style sheet can be applied to an unlimited number
of web pages. An external style sheet can be applied instantly to apply the look to each and every web page.
They can also help in bringing a uniform format to every page they are attached to.
In this method one file contains style codes of .css extension and another file contains the HTML code.
Then the CSS file is linked to the HTML document by this method using LINK element.
Steps to apply external style sheet in a HTML File are:
1) Create a html file.
2) Create an externalsheet file with .css extension.
3) Now, open the source code of the html file you have created and in the head section, by using the 
link element define its various attributes:
-> Href = specifies the location of external Stylesheet file's url
-> Rel = The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the 
     linked document.
-> Type = It  specifies the media type of the linked document/resource. The most common value of type
    is "text/css". If you omit the type attribute, the browser will look at the rel attribute 
   to guess the correct type. So, if rel="stylesheet", the browser will assume the type is "text/css".
Example:  &ltHEAD&gt
&ltLINK Rel="Stylesheet" Type="text/css" Href="----.css"&gt
&lt/HEAD&gt

Tip: You can also link to style sheets with HTTP headers.
For example -> Copy the link of CSS style code website and write in the given format:
&ltLINK rel="stylesheet" href="http://www.acme.com/corporate.css"&gt

             <h1><u>Importing Stylesheets</u></h1>
<h3>Imported Style Sheets allow us to import style rules from other style sheets. 
To import CSS rules we have to use @import before all the rules in a style sheet.
i.e.,
&ltstyle type=”text/css&gt
@import URL (cssfilepath.css);
&lt/style&gt

In this method also, we have to create a style code file with .css extension and a html file.
But here instead of linking the style code with LINK element, we use import statement to import the style code..
Steps to use import statement:
1) Input &ltSTYLE&gt tag in the Head section. 
2) Then write -> @Import url(----.css) 
3) Then close the style tag.
<div class="alert">
<span class="closebtn" onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none';">&times;</span>
Info: Always use "@" before import i.e., @import
</div>
Example: 
&ltHEAD&gt
&ltSTYLE&gt
@Import url(---.css)
&lt/STYLE&gt
&lt/HEAD&gt
